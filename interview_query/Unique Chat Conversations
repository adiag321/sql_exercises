WhatsApp is a popular messaging platform that allows users to send and receive text messages, voice notes, and multimedia messages in real-time. Users can engage in one-on-one chats or group chats, and every message sent has a unique identifier.

You're given a table, messenger_sends, with the following columns:

date: the date the message was sent.
ts: the timestamp of when the message was sent.
sender_id: the unique identifier for the sender of the message.
receiver_id: the unique identifier for the receiver of the message.
message_id: a unique identifier for each message.
Given that a conversation thread between two users A and B remains the same whether A messages B or B messages A, write a SQL query to determine how many unique conversation (unique_conversations) threads are present in the messenger_sends table.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT least_value || '_' || greatest_value) AS unique_conversations
FROM (
    SELECT 
        CASE WHEN sender_id < receiver_id THEN sender_id ELSE receiver_id END AS least_value,
        CASE WHEN sender_id > receiver_id THEN sender_id ELSE receiver_id END AS greatest_value
    FROM messenger_sends
) AS subquery;
