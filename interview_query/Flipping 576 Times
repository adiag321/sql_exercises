You flip a fair coin 576 times. Without using a calculator, calculate the probability of flipping at least 312 heads.

This question requires some memorization. At first glance we can infer that it’s a binomial distribution problem given that we have to guess the number of heads out of a number of trials. Therefore similar to a binomial distribution with 
�
n trials and probability of success 
�
p on each trial.

Looking at the formulas for the binomial distribution: 

The mean is

np
The variance is

)
np(1−p)
The standard deviation is

)
np(1−p)

We know that the expected number of heads is 0.5 * 576 = 288. Then you would have to remember that the standard deviation of the binomial distribution is 
�
�
(

�
)
np(1−p)
​
 . 

We know that 
�
p is 0.5 for the probability of success of flipping heads. If we calculate the formula out for the standard deviation we get:

We now can figure out that 312 is 2 standard deviations above the mean given that 24 + 288 = 312.

So due to the binomial approximation to the normal distribution, we know that at 
±
± 2 standard deviations that 5% of the distribution is on the tails, which means 2.5% chance of 312 or more heads.

shorter explanation

Fair coin, p(H)=0.5 For binomial distribution, mean=np=576*0.5=288, var=np(1-p)=576*0.5*0.5=144, stddev=sqrt(var)=12.

For normal distribution, “68% of the data falls within one standard deviation, 95% percent within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations from the mean.”

312= 288(mean)+2*12(stddev), which means the probability of flipping at least 312 heads or tails is 5%. Since we are only looking at the probability of at least 321 heads, it is the right tail area of the distribution, which 
is 5%/2= 2.5%. So the probability of flipping at least 312 heads is 2.5%.
