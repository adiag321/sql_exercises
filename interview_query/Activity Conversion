You’re given three tables, users, transactions and events. We’re interested in how user activity affects user purchasing behavior. 

The events table holds data for user events on the website where the action field would equal values such as like and comment.

Write a query to prove if users that interact on the website (likes, comments) convert towards purchasing at a higher volume than users that do not interact.

SELECT 
  AVG(t.num_transactions) AS avg_transactions_with_interactions,
  AVG(t2.num_transactions) AS avg_transactions_without_interactions
FROM (
  SELECT 
    e.user_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.id) AS num_transactions
  FROM events e
  INNER JOIN transactions t
      ON e.user_id = t.user_id
  WHERE e.action IN ('like', 'comment')
  GROUP BY e.user_id
) t
INNER JOIN (
  SELECT 
    u.id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.id) AS num_transactions
  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN events e
      ON u.id = e.user_id
          AND e.action IN ('like', 'comment')
  INNER JOIN transactions t
      ON u.id = t.user_id
  WHERE e.user_id IS NULL
  GROUP BY u.id
) t2
ON t.user_id = t2.id
