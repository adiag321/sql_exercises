There are two lists, list X and list Y. Both lists contain integers from -1000 to 1000 and are identical to each other except that one integer is removed in list Y that exists in list X.

Write a function one_element_removed that takes in both lists and returns the integer that was removed in

def one_element_removed(list_x,list_y):

  return sum(list_x) - sum(list_y)
