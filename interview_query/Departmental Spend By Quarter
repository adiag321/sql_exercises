'''
Suppose we have a table of transactions happened during 2023, with each transaction belonging to different departments within a company. We want to calculate the total spend for IT, HR, and Marketing, and also have a total for Other departments, grouped by fiscal quarters.

Write a query to display this result.

Note: Display only quarters where at least one transaction occurred. Quarter names should be Q1,Q2,Q3 and Q4. Q1 is from January to March
