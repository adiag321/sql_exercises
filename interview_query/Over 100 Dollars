Youâ€™re given two dataframes: transactions and products.

The transactions dataframe contains transaction ids, product ids, and the total amount of each product sold.

The products dataframe contains product ids and prices.

Write a function to return a dataframe containing every transaction with a total value of over

100
$100. Include the total value of the transaction as a new column in the dataframe.
