Given a table with event logs, find the percentage of users that had at least one seven-day streak of visiting the same URL.

Note: Round the results to 2 decimal places. For example, if the result is 35.67% return 0.35.




with h as(
select 

distinct user_id,date(created_at) as login_date
from events),

grouped as(

select *, login_date-row_number()over(partition by user_id order by login_date) as grp
from h),
streaks as(

    select user_id, max(login_date)-min(login_date) + 1 as streak
    from grouped group by grp
)

select round(

    (select count(*)  from (select user_id from streaks group by  user_id having max(streak)>=7) as qualified_users )
    /count(distinct user_id),2) as percent_of_users

    from streaks
