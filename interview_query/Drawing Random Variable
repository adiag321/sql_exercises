You’re drawing from a random variable that is normally distributed 
�
∼
�
(
0
,
1
)
X∼N(0,1)  once per day.

What is the expected number of days that it takes to draw a value that’s higher that 2?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our random variable 
�
X has a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. This is denoted 
�
(
00
,
1
)
N(00,1) and is called the standard normal distribution.

So the further a value is from our mean 0, the less likely it is to be drawn from our distribution. In our case, we want the probability that we draw a value greater than 2.

We denote this probability 
�
(
�
>
2
)
P(x>2) where x is a value drawn from our random variable 
�
X. In mathematics, it’s often easier to calculate the probability of an event occurring by first calculating the probability that it will not occur.

The probability that we draw a number from our distribution is 100%. This is to say 
�
(
draw 
�
)
=
1
P(draw x)=1. Since it must be the case that 
�
≤
2
x≤2 or 
�
>
2
x>2, we can assert truthfully that:

�
(
�
>
2
)
=
1
−
�
(
�
≤
2
)
P(x>2)=1−P(x≤2)

Why is this useful? As it turns out, there is a simple way to calculate 
�
(
�
≤
2
)
P(x≤2). For any random variable 
�
V with values 
�
v, there exists a unique cumulative distribution function or CDF (denoted 
�
�
(
�
)
F 
V
​
 (v) such that for any value 
�
t,
�
(
�
≤
�
)
=
�
�
(
�
)
P(v≤t)=F 
V
​
 (t)

In our case, we can plug 2 into the CDF of the standard normal distribution to calculate 
�
(
�
≤
2
)
P(x≤2).

�
(
�
≤
2
)
=
Φ
(
2
)
=
0.97725
P(x≤2)=Φ(2)=0.97725

Then

�
(
�
>
2
)
=
1
−
0.97725
=
0.02275
P(x>2)=1−0.97725=0.02275

Now that we have the probability of drawing a value greater than 2, we want to find the expected number of days until we draw it.

Think about a two sided coin. How many flips do we expect it to take until we flip heads? Intuitively, since there is a 1⁄2 chance of flipping heads, we expect it to take two flips.

Similarly, if we pick a value of a six sided fair die, we might expect six rolls until we roll our chosen value. Each value has a 
�
=
1
/
6
p=1/6 chance of being rolled, and our expected number of rolls is 
1
/
�
=
1
/
(
1
/
6
)
=
6
1/p=1/(1/6)=6.

Such is the case for any process with repeated selection and a constant probability of success. In our problem, we repeatedly select a value from 
�
X with constant probability of success 
�
=
0.02275
p=0.02275.

So our expected number of draws until success is calculated as:

1
/
�
=
1
/
(
0.02275
)
=
43.9
1/p=1/(0.02275)=43.9

Since we make one selection per day, and since we still don’t expect to have drawn (x > 2) by the 43rd day, we expect our process to take 44 days.
