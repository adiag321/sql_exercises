'''
Letâ€™s say you work in air traffic control. You are given the table below containing information on flights between two cities.

Write a query to find out how much time, in minutes (rounded down), each plane spent in the air each day.

Note: Both cities are in the same time zone, so you do not need to worry about converting time zones.
