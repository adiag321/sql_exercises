Let’s say we’re given a biased coin that comes up heads 30% of the time when tossed.

What is the probability of the coin landing as heads exactly 5 times out of 6 tosses?

Let’s break down the prompt. We’re given two pieces of information in this scenario.

Heads comes up 30% of the time in a biased coin.
What’s the probability of exactly 5 heads out of 6 tosses.
Given these parameters, we can immediately infer using the binomial distribution!

We’re given two parameters in which in a binomial distribution there exists 
�
n independent experiments, each asking a yes–no question, and each with its own boolean-valued outcome: success/yes/true/one with probability 
�
p.

 (1−p) 
n−k
 

In this case, we can assume 
�
p, the probability, is 40% from the heads-tails/yes-no question, and 
�
n, is the six tosses that we’re making. The variable 
�
X is the number of heads that we want to predict the probability outcome of.

Given these parameters we can now calculate the probability of by plugging in the variables. Notice that the first part of the equation represents n choose k which is equated to this:
