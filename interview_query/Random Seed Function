Let’s say you have a function that outputs a random integer between a minimum value, 
�
N, and maximum value, 
�
M. 

Now let’s say we take the output from the random integer function and place it into another random function as the max value with the same min value 
�
N. 

What would the distribution of the samples look like?

What would be the expected value?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let 
�
X be the result of the first run and 
�
Y be the result of the second run. Since the integer outputted is “random” and no additional information is given, we can assume all integers between and including 
�
N and 
�
M have an equal shot at being selected. Thus, 
�
X and 
�
Y are discrete uniform random variables with bounds 
�
N & 
�
M and 
�
N & 
�
X respectively. From the definition of the conditional probability mass function (pmf) of two discrete random variables, we know:
�
�
∣
�
(
�
)
=
�
�
,
�
(
�
,

(
�
)
p 
Y∣X
​
 (y)= 
p 
X
​
 (x)
p 
X,Y
​
 (x,y)
​
 
Rearranging we get:
�
�

(

)
⋅
�

(
�
)
=

(

The pmf of a discrete uniform random variable 
�
D with min value 
�
a and max value 
�
b is:

 (d)=

The joint pmf of 
�
X and 
�
Y would be:

�

�
(

)
=

Since we don’t know what 
�
N and 
�
M are explicitly, we can’t calculate the expected value join the joint pmf. However, we can use the *law of iterated expectation_, which states that for two random variables 
�
X and 
�
Y:
�
[
�
]
=
�
[
�
[
�
∣

]
]
E[Y]=E[E[Y∣X]]
The mean of a discrete uniform random variable 
�
D with bounds 
�
a and 
�
b is
�
[

=

E[D]=

​
 
Thus,
�
[
�
∣

]
=

�

E[Y∣X]= 
2
X+N
​
 
So
�
[

=

[

[

]
=

[
