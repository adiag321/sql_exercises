Weâ€™re given three tables representing a forum of users and their comments on posts.

Write a query to get the top three users that got the most upvotes on their comments written in 2020. 

Note: Do not count deleted comments and upvotes by users on their own comments


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SELECT 
u.id,  sum(is_upvote) as upvotes,username
 FROM comments c join users u on u.id = c.user_id 
join comment_votes cv on cv.comment_id = c.id
where year(c.created_at) = 2020 
and c.user_id <> cv.user_id and is_deleted = 0

group by u.id, username
order by upvotes desc limit 3

SELECT 
  u.id,
  u.username,
  SUM(is_upvote) AS upvotes
FROM comments AS c
