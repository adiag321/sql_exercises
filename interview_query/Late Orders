Let’s say that you work at a food delivery company. You’re tasked with discovering how late the late orders actually are.

Which is a better metric to look at? The average or the median?
Let’s say that you model out the distribution and it’s right-skewed. Which metric should we use then?
What does that tell us about the late orders?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The average. since we want to reflect that a lot of the orders are actually only a tiny bit late.
If it is right skewed, we can consider median, since it will not be affected by those extreme values on the right.
Most of the orders are late with next to 0 minutes, while a tiny fraction of the orders are late for a long shot.
