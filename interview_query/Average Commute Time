Letâ€™s say you work at Uber. The rides table contains information about the trips of Uber users across America

Write a query to get the average commute time (in minutes) for each commuter 
in New York (NY) and the average commute time (in minutes) across all commuters in New York.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT 

distinct commuter_id,
floor(avg(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_dt, end_dt))over(partition by city, commuter_id)) as avg_commuter_time,
floor(avg(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,start_dt, end_dt))over(partition by city)) as avg_time
FROM rides 
 where city = "NY"
