You work as a data scientist for a grocery store chain that has a mobile app. At the end of the checkout process on the app, users are presented with an up-sell carousel, a sliding display of items that users can scroll/swipe to view and add to their cart. Currently, the carousel only presents items from the store’s personal brand.

How would you determine whether the carousel should replace store-brand items with national-brand products of the same type?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s break down our solution into multiple steps.

1. Define the success metric

Our first step has to be to identify a key performance indicator that measures the impact of the new product substitution. One example would be the Margin per ATC.

Margin per ATC can be calculated by taking (Margin of the carousel slot/Total ATC of the slot) within a specific time frame, where the margin represents the difference between the price and the cost of goods sold. ATC stands for add-to-cart, indicating the number of times customers add an item to their cart within the app.

Here, a higher Margin per ATC would indicate increased profitability, reflecting the success of the product substitution.

2. Determine the demand for product substitution

Our next step is to utilize the available online and offline data to determine the demand for product substitution.

This can include monitoring customer behavior to identify patterns related to the current up-sell carousel– specifically, how many times customers interact with the carousel and then subsequently add a national brand item to their cart.

If a significant portion of customers are switching from the store-brand to national-brand products, it suggests potential demand for substituting national-brand products into the carousel.

3. Perform an A/B test

To evaluate the performance of two different versions of the up-sell carousel, one with store-brand and the other with national-brand items, we can conduct an A/B test. Users would be randomly assigned to two groups, where Group A sees the store-brand products, and Group B sees the national brand. After tracking relevant metrics, including Margin per ATC, over a period of time, we could analyze whether there’s a statistically significant difference in Margin per ATC between the two groups.

Other things to consider include making sure that the test is properly powered to detect meaningful differences and controlling for potential confounding variables.

Suppose the group exposed to the national brand products carousel shows a significantly higher Margin per ATC. This would prove that replacing store-brand items is profitable, and the product substitution should be implemented in the app.

4. Monitor and iterate

After making changes to the carousel, it’s important to continue to monitor performance. Depending on user behavior and feedback, improvements can be made to optimize the product substitution further.
