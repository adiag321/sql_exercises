Netflix is a popular streaming platform that offers a wide variety of movies spanning multiple genres. Users can rate movies they've watched, providing 
valuable feedback on the content. With the diverse selection, understanding the average rating for each genre can help in content recommendation and analysis.

Write a SQL query that returns a table listing each movie, its average rating and
the average rating of its genre. The table should have columns for the movie title title, the average movie rating avg_rating, and the average genre rating genre_rating. Order the result by the movie title. Round ratings to 1 decimal place
