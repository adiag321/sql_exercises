An online marketplace company has introduced a new feature that allows potential buyers and sellers to conduct audio chats with each other prior to transacting.

Letâ€™s say we have two tables that represent this data.

Example:

Input:

chats table

Column	Type
id	INTEGER
buyer_user_id	INTEGER
seller_user_id	INTEGER
call_length	INTEGER
call_connected	INTEGER
marketplace_purchases table

Column	Type
id	INTEGER
buyer_user_id	INTEGER
seller_user_id	INTEGER
item_id	INTEGER
purchase_amount	FLOAT
How would you measure the success of this new feature?
Write a query that can represent if the feature is successful or not.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH distinct_chats AS (
    SELECT 
        c.buyer_user_id 
        , c.seller_user_id
        , MAX(call_connected) AS at_least_one_call_connected
        , COUNT(DISTINCT mp.id) AS completed_transaction
    FROM chats AS c 
    LEFT JOIN marketplace_purchases AS mp  
        ON mp.buyer_user_id = c.buyer_user_id
            AND mp.seller_user_id = c.seller_user_id 
    GROUP BY 1,2
)

SELECT at_least_one_call_connected
    , AVG(completed_transaction)
    , SUM(completed_transaction)
FROM distinct_chats 
GROUP BY at_least_one_call_connected
