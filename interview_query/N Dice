Let’s say you’re playing a dice game. You have 2 dice.

What’s the probability of rolling at least one 3?

What’s the probability of rolling at least one 3 given 
�
N dice?
----------------------------------------------------------------
1.

We’re given two die and at least one three has to come up.

In this case we understand that in the AT LEAST probability question, it’s much easier to solve by figuring out the combo of never rolling a three.

In this case we can further break it down by understanding the probability of rolling a three with one die is 1⁄6. To not roll a three we would do 1 - 1⁄6 = 5⁄6.

Now what happens with two die? We can multiply the probabilities. So the probability of never getting a 3 with two die is 5⁄6 * 5⁄6 = 25⁄36

Now we can run the formula again of 1 - 25⁄36 = 11⁄36

2.

How do we now encapsulate this for 
�
N die? We can follow the same methodology but create a formula.

Given the probabilities are multiples, we know for:

3 die -> (5⁄6) * (5⁄6) * (5⁄6)
4 die -> (5⁄6) * (5⁄6) * (5⁄6) * (5⁄6)

So then for 
�
N die it would be:

�
(
At least one 3
)
=
1
−
(
5
/
6
)
�
P(At least one 3)=1−(5/6) 
N
