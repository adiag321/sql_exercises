Consider the events table which contains information about the phases of writing a new social media post.

The action column can have values post_enter, post_submit, or post_canceled for when a user starts
to write (post_enter), ends up canceling their post (post_cancel), or posts it (post_submit).

Write a query to get the post success rate for each day in the month of January 2020.

You can assume that a single user may only make one post per day.


SELECT 
 date(created_at) as dt,
sum(case when action = 'post_submit' then 1 else 0 end)/
sum(case when action = 'post_enter' then 1 else 0 end) as post_success_rate
from events
where year(created_at) = 2020 and month(created_at) =1

group by date(created_at)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT 
    DATE(c1.created_at) AS dt
    , COUNT(c2.user_id) / COUNT(c1.user_id) AS post_success_rate
FROM events AS c1
LEFT JOIN events AS c2
    ON c1.user_id = c2.user_id
        AND c2.action = 'post_submit'
        AND DATE(c1.created_at) = DATE(c2.created_at)
WHERE c1.action = 'post_enter'
    AND MONTH(c1.created_at) = 1
    AND YEAR(c1.created_at) = 2020
GROUP BY 1
