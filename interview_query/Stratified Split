'''
Letâ€™s say you work as a medical researcher.

You are given a dataframe of patient data containing the age of the patient and two columns, smoking and cancer, indicating if the patient is a smoker or has cancer, respectively.

Write a function, stratified_split, that splits the dataframe into train and test sets while preserving the approximate ratios for the values in a specified column (given by a col variable). Do not return the training set. Instead, return the number of columns in the training set that are in the "no" class of col

Note: Do not use scikit-learn.

import pandas as pd

train_ratio = 0.7
col = "cancer"

def stratified_split(train_ratio,col,patients: pd.DataFrame):
    
    cancer = patients[patients[col]=='yes']
    nocancer = patients[patients[col]=='no']

    yesc = cancer.sample(frac= train_ratio)
    noc = nocancer.sample(frac=train_ratio)

    main = pd.concat([yesc,noc])
    return len(main[main[col]=='no'])
