Let’s say you flip a fair coin 10 times.

What is the probability that you only get three tails, but, all the tails happen consecutively?

An example of this happening would be if the flips were HHHHTTTHHH.

Bonus: What would the probability of getting only t tails in n coin flips (t ≤ n), requiring that the tails all happen consecutively?

------------------------------------------------------------
Let’s think about the results of our flips as a 10-character long string. This would be something like 
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
HHHTHTHTHH. Because every character in the string has 2 possible options (
�
T or 
�
H), we have 
2
10
2 
10
  possible results from our flips.

For our result to have only three tails that all appear consecutively, we need only consider when the first 
�
T appears in the string representation of the flips. There are 8 possible positions for the first 
�
T (since it can’t be placed at the last or second-to-last position, as there wouldn’t be three 
�
Ts then):

�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
TTTHHHHHHH
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
HTTTHHHHHH
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
HHTTTHHHHH
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
HHHTTTHHHH
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
HHHHTTTHHH
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
HHHHHTTTHH
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
HHHHHHTTTH
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
�
HHHHHHHTTT

Thus, the desired probability is 
8

10
2

8
​
 .

Bonus:

By the same logic as the regular answer, we have 
2
�
2 
n
  possible results. Let’s consider the result where all 
�
t of the tails come at the end.

What would be the index of the first 
�
T in the string representation? Well, you might think that it appears in the 
(
�
−
�
)
(n−t)th spot, but that would mean that the character in the 
(
�
−
�
−
1
)
(n−t−1)th spot is 
�
H. So with 
(
�
−
�
−
1
)
(n−t−1) heads and 
�
t tails, we would only have 
(
�
−
1
)
(n−1) flips! Thus the position of the first 
�
T would actually need to be 
(
�
−
�
+
1
)
(n−t+1) when all tails are at the end.

Now, as before, we can switch the index of the first 
�
T to any of the positions before 
(
�
−
�
+
1
)
(n−t+1), so the desired probability is
�
−
�
+
1
