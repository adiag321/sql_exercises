Given two string representations of very large integers, create a 
Python function, string_sum, that returns the sum of these two integers as a string. Each string integer may start with a '+' or '-' sign.

Treat these strings as if they were extremely large (gigabytes in size), so usual 
conversion methods to integers donâ€™t work due to memory constraints.


def string_sum(num1, num2):
    
    final = 0

    if num1[0] == '+':
        final += int(num1[1:])
    else:
        final -= int(num1[1:])
    

    if num2[0] == '+':
        final += int(num2[1:])
    else:
        final -= int(num2[1:])
    
    return str(final)
