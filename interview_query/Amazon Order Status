'''
Amazon is a global e-commerce company that allows vendors to sell their products online to customers. Customers can order products and track their orders' status, such as 'Pending', 'Shipped', 'Delivered', etc.

You're given a table, orders, with the following columns:

order_id (integer): a unique identifier for each order
order_date (date): the date the order status was updated
status (string): the status of the order, e.g., 'Pending', 'Shipped', 'Delivered', etc.
Write a SQL query that returns a table with the order_id, status, start_date, and end_date for each status period of a particular order. If a status is the first for that order, then the end_date should be NULL."
