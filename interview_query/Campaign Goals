Letâ€™s say we have a schema that represents advertiser campaigns and impressions. The campaigns table specifically has a goal, which is the number that the advertiser wants to reach in total impressions. 

Given the table above, generate a daily report that tells us how each campaign delivered during the first 7 days. Round output to 4 decimals.

Using this data, how do we evaluate how each campaign is delivering and by what heuristic do we surface promos that need attention?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT ai.campaign_id
, ROUND(COUNT(ai.impression_id)/7,4) AS first_seven_days_average
, ROUND( c.goal/(DATEDIFF(c.end_dt,c.start_dt)), 4) AS expected_daily_average
, ROUND((COUNT(ai.impression_id)/c.goal *100),4) AS percent_delivered
, ROUND((7/(DATEDIFF(c.end_dt,c.start_dt))*100),4) AS percent_days_passed
FROM ad_impressions ai, campaigns c 
WHERE ai.campaign_id = c.id
and ai.dt BETWEEN c.start_dt AND DATE_ADD(c.start_dt, INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY ai.campaign_id
ORDER BY ai.campaign_id
