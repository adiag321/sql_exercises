Youâ€™re playing casino dice game. You roll a die once. If you reroll, you earn the amount equal to the 
number on your second roll otherwise, you earn the amount equal to the number on your first roll.

Assuming you adopt a profit-maximizing strategy, what would be the expected amount of money you would win?

----------------------------------
When you roll the first die with a value of 1, 2, 3, then you should always roll the second die since the expected value for rolling a single die is 3.5. This is done by taking the total sum of the values divided by the number of options: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)/6 = 3.5

So when you roll a 1, 2, 3 then the actual expected value is 3.5 If you roll a 4, 5, 6 on the first die, then the expected value is 5 and you should not roll the second die.

The overall expected monetary value then comes to (3.5+5)/2 = 4.25

Here is the code to simulate it:


import numpy as np
for threshold in range(1, 6):
    rolls   = np.random.randint(1, 7, size=10**7)
    rerolls = np.random.randint(1, 7, size=10**7)
    avg_roll = np.mean(np.where(rolls <= threshold, rerolls, rolls))
    print(f'Rerolling all {threshold}s and below yields and average roll of {avg_roll}.')
