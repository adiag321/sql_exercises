Write a query that creates an attribution rule for each user. If the user visited Facebook or Google at least once 
then the attribution is labeled as “paid.” Otherwise, the attribution is labeled as “organic.”


with h as(
select 
user_id, 'paid' as attribute
from attribution a inner join user_sessions u
 on u.session_id = a.session_id
where channel in ('facebook', 'google') ) ,

h2 as (select user_id, 'organic' as attribute  from attribution a inner join user_sessions u on u.session_id = a.session_id where user_id not in (select user_id from h) )

select * from  h
union 
 select * from h2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN (channel = 'Facebook' OR channel = 'Google') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS paid_count
    FROM user_sessions
        JOIN attribution ON 
            user_sessions.session_id = attribution.session_id
    GROUP BY user_id)

SELECT
    user_id,
    CASE WHEN paid_count >=1 THEN 'paid' ELSE 'organic' END AS attribute
FROM cte
