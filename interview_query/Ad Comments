'''
You’re given three tables.

An ads table holds an ID and the advertisement name like “Labor day shirts sale”. The feed_comments table holds the comments on ads by different users that occur in the regular feed. The moments_comments table holds the comments on ads by different users in the moments section.

Write a query to get the percentage of comments, by ad, that occurs in the feed versus mentions sections of the app.
