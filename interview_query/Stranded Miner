A miner is stranded and there are two paths he can take.

Path 
�
A loops back to itself and takes him 5 days to walk it.

Path 
�
B brings him to a junction immediately (0 days). The junction at the end of path 
�
B has two paths: Path 
�
�
BA and Path 
�
�
BB.

Path 
�
�
BA brings him back to his original starting point and takes him 2 days to walk. Path 
�
�
BB brings him to safety and takes him 1 day to walk.

Each path has an equal probability of being chosen and once a wrong path is chosen, the miner gets disoriented and cannot remember which path he went through.

What is the expected value of the amount of days he will spend before he exits the mine?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, some terminology. We will call a particular sequence through the mine a circuit and a decision to go down one path a walk. This terminology is borrowed from graph theory.

We will denote the number of days that the miner spends stranded as 
�
D. Note that 
�
D is path-dependent; the sequence of paths the miner takes matters—for example, the circuit.

�
→
�
→
�
→
�
�
A→A→B→AB

takes 11 days to complete, while the circuit

�
→
�
�
→
�
→
�
�
B→BA→B→AB

takes three days to complete, even though the minor got to 
�
�
BB in the same amount of “walks.” Due to this, Calculating 
�
[
�
]
E[D] directly would require you to come up with a formula to generate the probability of every possible circuit. Not impossible, but not something you’re going to be able to do on the spot in an interview.

Because of this difficulty, we won’t focus on 
�
D. Instead, we will focus on the number of “walks” the miner makes, that is, the number of times they go down a path. We will denote this as 
�
W.

Note that since 
�
W measures trials until a success, it lends itself a geometric distribution. At the start of any circuit, the probability of ending up at path 
�
�
BB is

�
(
�
�
)
=
�
(
�
�
∣
�
)
�
(
�
)
=
0.25
P(BB)=P(BB∣B)P(B)=0.25

Thus, 
�

�
]
=

Now, let’s think about the number of days per walk when he’s trapped. Since in the long-run, half, a quarter, and a quarter of all circuits end up in 
�
,
�
�
A,BA, and 
�
�
BB respectively, we have
