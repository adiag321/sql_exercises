'''
We have a table that represents the total number of messages sent between two users by date on messenger.

What are some insights that could be derived from this table?

What do you think the distribution of the number of conversations created by each user per day looks like?

Write a query to get the distribution of the number of conversations created by each user by day in the year 2020.

with h as(
SELECT 

user1,DATE(date) as day, count(distinct user2) as num_conversations
 FROM messages 
where year(date)= 2020

group by 1,2 )

select 

num_conversations,
count(*)  as frequency

 from h

 group by num_conversations
