An animal appears normal if it has two normal genes or one normal and one mutated gene. If it has two mutated genes, it appears mutated. Any given animal has a 50% chance to contribute either of its genes to its offspring.

Animals 
�
A and 
�
B are parents of 
�
C and 
�
D. 
�
C and 
�
D are parents of 
�
E. 
�
A and 
�
B both have one normal and one mutated gene. We know 
�
C and 
�
D both appear normal.

What is the probability that 
�
D has one normal and one mutated gene given that 
�
E appears normal?
-------------------------------------------------------------
We will denote the genes of an animal 
�
Y by the pairings of 
�
μ, indicating a mutated gene, and 
�
ν, indicating a normal gene. For example, 
�
�
�
Y 
νμ
​
  indicates that 
�
Y has one normal gene and one mutated gene, while 
�
�
�
Y 
μμ
​
  indicates that both genes are mutated. Finally, 
�
�
∗
Y 
ν∗
​
  will denote the event that 
�
Y looks normal, since 
�
Y would only need one normal gene to look normal.

Do not be confused by the fact that the question says to condition on 
�
�
∗
E 
ν∗
​
  specifically, we are actually given three pieces of information: 
�
�
∗
,
�
�
∗
,
C 
ν∗
​
 ,D 
ν∗
​
 , and 
�
�
∗
E 
ν∗
​
 . An interviewer would want use to use all of your prior knowledge whe considering the question, so we would like to find 
�

�

�

)
P(D

​
 ∣C 
ν∗
​
 ∩D 
ν∗
​
 ∩E 
ν∗
​
 ).

For brevity we will call 
(
�
�
∗
∩
�
�

∩
�
�
∗
)
=
�
(C 
ν∗
​
 ∩D

​
 ∩E

​
 )=N.

From the definition of conditional probability, we know:

�
(
�
�
�
∣
�
)
=
�
(
�
∩
�
�
�
)
�
(
�
)
P(D 
νμ
​
 ∣N)= 
P(N)
P(N∩D 
νμ
​
 )
​
 

But the definition of conditional probability also gives us a useful way of writing 
�
(
�
)
P(N)

�
(
�
)
=
�
(
�
�

�
�

�
�

)
�

�

�

P(N)=P(E

P(C 
ν∗
​
 ∩D 
ν∗
​
 )=P(C 
ν∗
​
 )P(D 
ν∗
​
 ) since 
�
�
∗
C 
ν∗
​
  and 
�
�
∗
D 
ν∗
​
  are independent events.

We have then, that:

�
(
�
�
�

�
)
=
�
(
�
�

�
�

  as a weighted average of all of its possibilities
