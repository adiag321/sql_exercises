A car starts driving at 60 mph, one hour later a car leaves the same position going 80 mph.

How much time will pass until the second car catches the first?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We can solve this by creating a linear algebra equation. Each side of the equation should represent each car traveling in speed.

In this case we have the first car which is driving at 60 mph which can be described as 
60
�
�
�
�
�
ℎ
�
�
�
⋅
�
60 
hour
miles
​
 ⋅x where 
�
X is time.

The second car leaving from the same position can be represented as 
80
�
�
�
�
�
ℎ
�
�
�
⋅
�
80 
hour
miles
​
 ⋅x with an addition of an hour which we will equate with the same denomination of 1. So the equation is 
80
(
�
−
1
)
80(x−1).

Now we solve the equation.

60
�
=
80
(
�
−
1
)
60X=80(X−1)
60
�
=
80
�
−
80
60X=80X−80
80
=
20
�
80=20X

=
4
hours
X=4hours
