You are the owner of an eCommerce platform. Letâ€™s say you would like to place an advertisement on Facebook.

The Facebook advertising team tells you that the cost of a specific ad placement is 
$
0.05
$0.05 per impression, and the click-through rate (clicks per impression) is 1%. On the other hand, based on your historical data, you have an average of 2% transaction rate on your website (number of transactions per website visit).

How much would the overall advertising cost per transaction be?

---------------------------------------------------------------------


1. calculate cost per click cpc - cost per impression/ctr = 0.05/0.01 = 5$
2. cost per transaction = cpc/transaction rate = 5$/0.02 = 250
