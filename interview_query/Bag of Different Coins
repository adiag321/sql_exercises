Let’s say you have a bag of coins. 
�
x of them are fair, 
�
y of them have heads on both sides, and 
�
z of them have tails on both sides.

If you draw 100 coins at random from the bag (with replacement) and flip each of them, what is the expected number of heads that you will see?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P(h|x) = 0.5

P(h|y) = 1

P(h|z) = 0

P(x) = x/(x+y+z)

P(y) = y/(x+y+z)

P(z) = z/(x+y+z)

P(h) = P(x)P(h|x) + P(z)P(h|z) + P(y)P(h|y)

P(h) = 0.5x/(x+y+z) + y/(x+y+z)

P(h) = (0.5x + y)/(x + y + z)

Therefore, expected value = 100*P(h) = 100(0.5x+y)/(x+y+z)
