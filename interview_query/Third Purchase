Given the transactions table below, write a query that finds the third purchase of every user.

Note: Sort the results by the user_id in ascending order. If a user 
purchases two products at the same time, the lower id field is used to determine which is the first purchase.



with h as(
select 

user_id, created_at,product_id, quantity,
rank()over(partition by user_id order by created_at, id ) as rnk from transactions)
select user_id,created_at,product_id,quantity from h where rnk = 3
