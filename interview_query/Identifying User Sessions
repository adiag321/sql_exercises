Suppose you have an events table that tracks user activities on a website. Write a query to identify and label each event with a session number. All events in the same session should be labeled with the same session number.

Note: A session is defined as a series of consecutive events for a user that are within 60 minutes of each other.

i.e. If a user has a series of events at 00:01:00, 00:30:00, 01:01:00, this would be considered 1 session but a series of events at 00:01:00, 00:30:00, 01:31:00 would be 2 sessions.
