Let’s say you’re trying to calculate churn for a subscription product.

You noticed that of all customers that bought subscriptions in January 2020, about 10% of them canceled their membership before their next cycle on February 1st.  

If you assume that your new customer acquisition is uniform throughout each month and that customer churn goes down by 20% month over month, what’s the expected churn rate in March for all customers that bought the product since January 1st?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Let’s say that 
�
x customers buy a subscription each month. 10% of customers churn in by the start of February, so we have 
(
1
−
0.1
)
�
=
0.9
�
(1−0.1)x=0.9x customers on February 1st. 
�
x more customers will subscribe throughout February, of which again 
0.1
�
0.1x will churn. However, a number of customers that subscribed in January will also churn. Their churn rate will be 20% less than the initial churn rate of 10%, so the new churn rate will be 
0.1
⋅
(
1
−
0.2
)
=
0.08
0.1⋅(1−0.2)=0.08 or 8%.

Thus our total customer base will be 
0.9
(
1
−
0.08
)
�
+
0.9
�
0.9(1−0.08)x+0.9x. Our churn rate, on March 1st, will be:

0.9
(

0.08

=

0.9(1−0.08)x+0.9x
