Facebook is considering implementing a payment feature to Facebook Messenger. The feature would allow friends to pay one another in a similar way to Venmo by sending a payment message.

How would you determine whether or not this is a good business decision?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**clarifying questions:**
what is the end goal? turn fb platform into some super app, encompassing other aspects of life?
increase user engagement?
one need to clearly define the business goal.

**assesing requirements:**

alright, the end goal is to drive user engagement and teach people to use fb 
for micro payments 10$-100$, lending borrowing money sort of platform. similar to wechat in china.


**solution:**

to properly assess the business impact, one needs to cluster users into active users, users who are ready to send money thru fb.
assess the opportunity size, the majority of fb users only login to check msgs, check other profiles, updates. not actively engaged.

use metric like cost/benefit, adoption rate.
build small mvp, apply ab testing and offer the feature to active users in US.
see the adoption rate for the feature.

after assessing the initial impact, calculate whether its profitable or not to introduce and make it GA(generally available)


**validation:**

metrics to measure success: num of money transfers,  dau,wau, mau active senders or receivers.
