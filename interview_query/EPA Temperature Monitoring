The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitors the daily temperatures of different cities to study climate change and its impact. The agency believes that extreme fluctuations in temperature, such as a sudden rise after a day of fall, can have adverse environmental effects.

You are given a table city_temperatures, with the following columns:

date (date): The date of the recorded temperature.
temperature (float): The temperature recorded on that date.
Write an SQL query to identify days when the temperature rose at least 5 degrees after falling at least 3 degrees. Return the date and the temperature of those days.
