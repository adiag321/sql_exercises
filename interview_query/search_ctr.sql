'''
  Youâ€™re given a table that represents search results from searches on Facebook. The query column is the search term, position column represents each position the search result came in, and the rating column represents the human rating from 1 to 5 where 5 is high relevance and 1 is low relevance.

Each row in the search_events table represents a single search with the has_clicked column representing if a user clicked on a result or not. We have a hypothesis that the CTR is dependent on the search result rating.

Write a query to return data to support or disprove this hypothesis.
