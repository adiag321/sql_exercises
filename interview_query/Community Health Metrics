You work at Stack Overflow on the community team that monitors the health of the platform.

Community members can create a post to ask a question, and other users can reply with answers or comments to that question. The community can express their support for the post by upvoting or downvoting.

Example:

Input:

post_analytics table

Column	Type	Description
id	INTEGER	Primary key of posts table
user_id	INTEGER	ID of the user who created the post
created_at	DATETIME	Timestamp of the post
title	VARCHAR	Title of the post
body	VARCHAR	Text content of the post
comment_count	INTEGER	Total number of the comments on a post
view_count	INTEGER	Total number of the views on a post
answer_count	INTEGER	Total number of answers on a post
upvotes	INTEGER	Total number of upvotes on the post
Given a table of Stack Overflow posts data, suggest three metrics to monitor the health of the community.

Write the queries for these metrics in SQL.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 most basic metrics to assess the health of platform:

1) num of daily posts created


select timedate(created_at), count(id) from post_analytics

group by timedate(created_at)



2) weighted avg engagement score per post


select id, 0.3*(answer_count) + 0.3*upvotes + 0.4*view_count as general_engagement_per_post from post_analytics

group by id

3) daily dynamics total answer, view, upvote count

select timedate(created_at) as day, sum(answer_count)  as total_answer_count_per_day,

sum(upvotes) as total_upvote_per_day
sum(view_count) as total_view_per_day 
from post_analytics

group by timedate(created_at)
