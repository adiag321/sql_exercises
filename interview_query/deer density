Consider a national park that has a sizeable deer population inside the boundaries along with much of its surrounding area.

How would you estimate the deer population within the borders of the national park?



-------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  I would ask questions about the deer behavior - Are they more likely to be 
  concentrated in a certain area? - Are they mostly seen during a specific time of the day? - Do they have specific feeding behaviors that can influence their migration throughout the day (or a consistent period of time)

These questions are important to derive a representative sample.

If there are no specific migration patterns, we can sample the population of deer within 5 different parts of the surrounding area. The parts chosen will have an equal distribution of deer - male and female, and then old and young.

Then use this information to extrapolate on how many deer. population density = number of deer/acre of land. If the number of deer sighted is 10 per 1 acre of land. Thats the population density. Lets say there are 500 acres of land. This means that there will be approximately 5000 deer in the 500 acres of land.
