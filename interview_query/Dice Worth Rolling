Let’s play a game. You are given two fair six-sided dice and asked to roll them.

If the sum of the values on the dice equals seven, then you win 21 dollars. However, you must pay 
$
10
$10 for each roll.

Is this game worth playing?
-----------------------------------
First, we consider how many ways we can possibly roll a seven. Let 
�
1
D 
1
​
  and 
�
2
D 
2
​
  be the result of the first and second dice respectively. There are six ways that the sum 
(
�
1
+
�
2
)
=
7
(D 
1
​
 +D 
2
​
 )=7

�
1
=
1
,
�
2
=
6
D

​
 =1,D 
2
​
 =6

�
1
=
2
,
�
2
=

D

​
 =2,D 
2
​
 =5

�
1
=
3
,
�
2
=
4
D 
1
​
 =3,D 
2
​
 =4

�
1
=
4
,
�
2
=
3
D 
1
​
 =4,D 
2
​
 =3

�
1
=
5
,
�
2
=
2
D 
1
​
 =5,D 
2
​
 =2

�
1
=
6
,
�
2
=
1
D 
1
​
 =6,D 
2
​
 =1

Since there are 
6
6 results possible from both dice, there are 
6
2
=
36
6 
2
 =36. Thus,

�
(
�
1
+
�
2
=
7
)
=
6
36
=
1
6
P(D

​
 +D

​
 =7)= 
36

​
 =

​
 

We can use the expected value of 
(
�
1
+
�
2
)
(D 
1
​
 +D 
2
​
 ) to get an estimate of how much money we expect to gain from this game, on average. The expected value, denoted 
�
E for any random outcome (technically “random variable”) 
�
X is defined in terms of the probability of 
�
X being equal to some number 
�
x:

�
[
�
]
=
∑
�
∈
�
�
�
(
�
=
�
)
E[X]= 
x∈X
∑
​
 xP(X=x)

In plain English, the expected value is the sum of all outcomes times the probability of the outcome. 
�
X denotes set of all possible outcomes (“sample space”) of 
�
X. For example, Let’s call the profit you make from this game 
�
P. The “sample space” of 
�
P is 
�
=
{
11
,
−
10
}
P={11,−10} because we either make 
$
21
$21 dollars by rolling a seven or lose 
$
10
$10 dollars by not.

Thus the possible results from the game are:

�
(
�
=
�
)
=
{
11
with probability 
1
6
−
10
with probability 
5
6
P(P=p)={ 
11with probability  
6
1
​
 
−10with probability  
6
5
​
 
​
 

So the expected value of 
�
P is:

�
[
�
]
=
11
⋅
1
6
−
10
⋅
5
6
≈
−
6.5
E[P]=11⋅ 
6
1
​
 −10⋅ 
6
5
​
 ≈−6.5

Since 
�
[
�
]
<
0
E[P]<0, we on average lose money from playing this game. Thus, this game is not worth playing, it is, from the literal mathematical definition, a “gamble.”

Note on using expected values

Expected values can be misleading if they are the only information one relies on to make a decision. This typically happens when an outcomes have very different “scale.” Think of a lottery, 
�
L, where it costs 
$
500
$500 to enter, but you have 
5
%
5% chance to win 
$
11000
$11000. The expected value of the lottery is:

�
[
�
]
=
(
11000
−
500
)
⋅
0.05
−
500
⋅
0.95
=
50
E[L]=(11000−500)⋅0.05−500⋅0.95=50

Yes, 
�
[
�
]
>
0
E[L]>0, but the chance of profit are extremely low. One should consider other information, like disposable income, before making such a decision.

Since 
11
11 and 
−
10
−10 are very close to each other in absolute value, we didn’t need to worry about misusing the expected value.
