'''
Let’s say we want to build a naive recommender. We’re given two tables, one table called friends with a user_id and friend_id columns representing each user’s friends, and another table called page_likes with a user_id and a page_id representing the page each user liked.

Write an SQL query to create a metric to recommend pages for each user based on recommendations from their friend’s liked pages. 

Note: It shouldn’t recommend pages that the user already likes.

from friends f inner join page_likes p on f.friend_id = p.user_id)

select 
count(distinct t1.friend_id) as num_friend_likes,
 t1.page_id,t1.user_id


from t1 left join page_likes p1 on t1.page_id = p1.page_id
and t1.user_id = p1.user_id
