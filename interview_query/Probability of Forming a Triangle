Consider a stick of length 1. It is broken into three pieces at two randomly 
selected points. What is the probability that the three pieces can form a triangle?


To form a triangle, the length of any one side must be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. This condition must hold for all three sides.

Let’s denote the break points as 
�
X and 
�
Y, and without loss of generality, assume that 
�
<
�
X<Y. The lengths of the three pieces are then 
�
X, 
�
−
�
Y−X, and 
1
−
�
1−Y.

The triangle condition is therefore:

�
+
(
�
−
�
)
>
1
−
�
X+(Y−X)>1−Y which simplifies to 
�
<
0.5
Y<0.5
�
+
(
1
−
�
)
>
�
−
�
X+(1−Y)>Y−X which simplifies to 
�
>
0.5
X>0.5
(
�
−
�
)
+
(
1
−
�
)
>
�
(Y−X)+(1−Y)>X which always holds true
So, both 
�
X and 
�
Y must be less than 
0.5
0.5, which is a quarter of the unit square. Therefore, the probability is 
0.25
0.25.

This can be simulated in Python:

import numpy as np

N = 1000000
X = np.random.uniform(0, 1, N)
Y = np.random.uniform(0, 1, N)
count = np.sum((X < 0.5) & (Y < 0.5))

probability = count / N
