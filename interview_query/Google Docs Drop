How would you investigate a 10% drop in usage on Google Docs?

---------------------
First, I would seek to size the issue:

Which usage metric decreased? Down 10% compared to what? I’d compare its recent performance to benchmarks (vs. prior year, targets, run rate, etc).

Based on the answers to those questions, I’d identify the percentage/absolute difference, and time period to investigate.

Before running a full-scale investigative analysis, I’d also check for missing data, outages, holidays, prior year performance anomalies, etc. Sometimes a “drop” is purely a reporting issue.

Then, assuming further investigation is needed:

Break out performance by category (ideally, MECE groups in % and absolute YoY). referral channel, landing page, country/region, user type (new vs. existing, engaged vs. lapsed, business vs. personal, etc.) etc.

Domain experts can help to inform which categories are the most likely to yield interesting results.

Identify top drivers, if any, and quantify the impact of each area (for example, a -9k YoY decrease in enterprise accounts docs_created was the greatest single driver of last week’s -15k YoY (-10% YoY) docs_created decrease, although other account types were down YoY as well).

Ask PMs/subject matter experts in those areas what changed in the given time period, and inform them of the change if they’re unaware.
