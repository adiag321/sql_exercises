Amazon has a warehouse system where items on the website are located at different distribution centers across a city. Let’s say in one example city, the probability that a specific item X is available at warehouse A or warehouse B are 0.6 and 0.8 respectively.

Given that you’re a customer in this example city and the items are only found on the website if they exist in the distribution centers, what is the probability that the item X would be found on Amazon’s website?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let 
�
A and 
�
B be the events that item 
�
X is at location 
�
A and 
�
B respective

Let’s define our probabilities:

�
(
�
)
=
0.6
P(A)=0.6

�
(
�
)
=
0.8
P(B)=0.8

We want the probability that the item 
�
X is on the website in this city. That can be defined from the question as to the probability that item 
�
X is at location 
�
A or location 
�
B. Given our events are not mutually exclusive, we can represent this probability in equation form: 
�
(
�
 or 
�
)
=
�
(
�
∪
�
)
P(A or B)=P(A∪B)

The formula for the union probability is:

�
(
�
∪
�
)
=
�
(
�
)
+
�
(
�
)
−
�
(
�
∩
�
)
P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)

Now let’s compute using the information we have:

�
(
�
∩
�
)
=
0.6
⋅
0.8
=
0.48
P(A∩B)=0.6⋅0.8=0.48

�
(
�
∪
�
)
=
0.6
+
0.8
−
0.48
=
0.92
P(A∪B)=0.6+0.8−0.48=0.92

There is a 92% probability the item is listed on the website.
