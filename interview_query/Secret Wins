There are 100 students that are playing a coin-tossing game.

The students are given a coin to toss. If a student tosses the coin and it turns up heads, they win. If it comes up tails, then they must flip again.

If the coin comes up heads the second time, the students will lie and say they have won when they didn’t. If it comes up tails then they will say they have lost.

If 30 students at the end say they won, how many students do we expect actually won the game?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let 
�
W denote the number of students that actually won. Since we know that 30 students said they won, we only need to consider the students that said they one. By the rules of the question, these students all flipped heads on their first toss, so we need to consider their second toss further only.

By reducing our area of consideration like this, this becomes a simple question of how many heads we expect those students to have gotten. This situation can be modeled as a binomial distribution,
