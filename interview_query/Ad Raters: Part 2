Let’s say we use people to rate ads.

There are two types of raters. Random and independent from our point of view:

80% of raters are careful and they rate an ad as good (60% chance) or bad (40% chance). 
20% of raters are lazy and they rate every ad as good (100% chance).
Suppose a rater rates just three ads, and rates them all as good. What’s probability the rater was lazy?
2. Suppose a rater sees 
�
N ads and rates all of them as good. What happens to the probability the rater was lazy as 
�
N tends to infinity?

3. Suppose we want to exclude lazy raters. Can you come up with a rule for classifying raters as careful or lazy?

Q1.) Let 
�
3
G 
3
​
  be the event that the three ads are rated as good and 
�
L be the event that the user is lazy.

Then,
�
(
�

�

 +0.8⋅0.6

 =0.3728

And finally, we apply the definition of conditional probability:

�
(
�
∣
�
3
)
=
�
(
�

�
3
)
�
(

0.3728

P(L∣G

​
 )= 
P(G 
3
​
 )
P(L∩G 
3
​
 )
​
 = 
0.3728
0.2
​
 =0.5365

Q2.) Let 
�
�
G 
N
​
  be event that the 
�
N ads are rated as good. By Bayes’ rule:
�
(

We may now take the limit of

P(L∣G 
N
​
 ) with respect to

N using standard limit laws:

This should be intuitive, the more times we observe a rater rating every ad they see as good, we expect that it’s more likely that the rater is lazy.

Q3.) From the last question, we know that 
�
(
�
∣
�
�
)
P(L∣G 
N
​
 ) as a function 
�
(
�
)
P(N). It can be show that 
�
P is always increasing since its derivative is always positive:

Since

−ln(0.6)>0. As a rule, we can flag a user as “lazy” if they have rated all ads as good and the probability
