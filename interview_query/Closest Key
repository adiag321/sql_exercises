Given a dictionary with keys of letters and values of a list of letters, write a 
function closest_key to find the key with the input value closest to the beginning of the list.

def closest_key(d, c):
    

    key = ''
    mindis = 10**9+7

    for k,v in d.items():

        curlist = v
        for i in range(len(curlist)):

            if curlist[i] == c:
                if i < mindis:
                    key = k
                    mindis = i
    
    return key
