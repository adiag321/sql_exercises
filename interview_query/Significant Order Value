Let’s say that we have the average order value data separated by men and women.

Gender	AOV (USD)	Total purchases
Men	46.3	2500
Women	50.2	3500
Would the difference in AOV (average order value) be significant?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 To determine if the difference in AOV between men and women is significant, we can perform a hypothesis test. Here's how:

1. State the null hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in AOV between men and women.
2. State the alternative hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in AOV between men and women.
3. Choose a significance level (α): Typically, α is set to 0.05.
4. Calculate the test statistic: Since we have the means and standard deviations for both groups, we can use the t-test statistic formula:

   t = (M1 - M2) / √[(s1²/n1) + (s2²/n2)]

   where M1 and M2 are the means of the two groups, s1² and s2² are the variances of the two groups, and n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of the two groups.

5. Determine the degrees of freedom (df): For the t-test, df = n1 + n2 - 2.
6. Find the critical value(s): Using a t-table or online calculator, find the critical value(s) for the chosen significance level and degrees of freedom.
7. Compare the test statistic to the critical value(s): If the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than the critical value(s), reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in AOV between men and women. Otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Using the given data, we get:

t = (46.3 - 50.2) / √[(10.8/2500) + (14.9/3500)] = -1.77
df = 3000 - 2 = 2998

For α = 0.05 and df = 2998, the critical value is approximately ±1.96. Since the absolute value of the test statistic (-1.77) is less than the critical value (1.96), we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant difference in AOV between men and women.
