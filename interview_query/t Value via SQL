Letâ€™s say you are managing products for an eCommerce store. You think products from category 9 have a lower average price than those in all other categories.

Calculate the t-value and degrees of freedom for such a test. You do not need to calculate the p-value of the test.



WITH control_test AS (
    SELECT
        COUNT(IF(category_id != 9, id, NULL)) AS c_size,
        COUNT(IF(category_id = 9, id, NULL)) AS t_size,
        AVG(IF(category_id != 9, price, NULL)) AS c_mean,
        AVG(IF(category_id = 9, price, NULL)) AS t_mean,
        VAR_SAMP(IF(category_id != 9, price, NULL)) AS c_var,
        VAR_SAMP(IF(category_id = 9, price, NULL)) AS t_var
    FROM products
)
SELECT
    ROUND((t_mean-c_mean) / SQRT((c_var/c_size) + (t_var/t_size)),5)
    AS t_value,
    ROUND(POWER((c_var/c_size) + (t_var/t_size), 2) / 
    ((POWER(c_var/c_size, 2) / (c_size-1)) + 
     (POWER(t_var/t_size, 2) / (t_size-1)))) AS d_o_f
FROM control_test
