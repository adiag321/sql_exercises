Given two independent standard normal random variables 
�
X and 
�
Y, what’s the probability that 
2
�
>
�
2X>Y?
--------------------

Let’s look at this question a little closer.

We’re given two normal distributions. The values can either be positive or negative but each value is equally likely to occur. Since we know the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1, we understand that the distributions are also symmetrical across the y-axis.

In this scenario, we are equally likely to randomly sample a value that is greater than 0 or less than 0 from the distribution. 

Now, let’s take examples of random values that we could get from each scenario. There are about six different scenarios here.

�
>
�
X>Y: Both positive

�
>
�
X>Y: Both negative

�
<
�
X<Y: Both positive

�
<
�
X<Y: Both negative

�
>
�
X>Y: 
�
X is positive 
�
Y is negative

�
<
�
X<Y: 
�
X is negative Y is positive

We can simulate a random sampling by equating that all six are equally likely to occur. If we play out each scenario and plug the variables into 
2
�
>
�
2X>Y,  then we see about half of the time the statement is true, or 50%.

Why is this the case? Generally, if we go back to the fact that both distributions are symmetrical across the y-axis, we can intuitively understand that if both 
�
X and 
�
Y are random variables across the same distribution, we will see 
2
�
2X as being on average double positive or double negative the value that 
�
Y is.
