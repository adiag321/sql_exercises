Let’s say that you’re working on the Uber app. 

How would you design an incentive scheme for drivers such that they would more likely go into city areas where demand is high?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal: Drivers should go to areas with high demand

First analyse what are the factors preventing the drivers from not picking rides from those areas:

Too much time lapsed in high traffic area, high waiting time on driver side.

Ride not value for money

Unavailability of riders

For the driver, target for count of rides might hamper.

Higher chances of cancellation due to high waiting time on rider side.

Mitigation:

Show driver what he would be earning at the end of the trip.

Show driver the alternate route to reach quicker in high demand region.

Redirecting drivers to high demand areas/best fare areas.

Setting targets, hourly/weekly/daily wage guarantees and bonuses for completing a given number of rides.

Metric :

Density of ride requests = #rider_requests/minute for an area

Proportion Metric : Number of drivers per rider for an area
