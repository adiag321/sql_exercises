Let’s say you are in charge of shipments at Amazon.

There are two types of parcels you can ship packages in, say A and B. Packages delivered in parcel A are damaged during shipment with probability p, while packages delivered in parcel B are damaged with probability q.

What statistical test could you use to determine which parcel is better to use? What would the statistical test conclude if p=0.4 and q=0.6?

Note: Assume the values of p and q were obtained from data recorded from 200 shipments, half delivered with parcel A and half delivered with parcel B.

Since we want to compare the difference in the success rate of the two parcels, it would make sense to use a statistical test that - tests for the proportion - compares to sample

So clearly, the “two-sampled test of proportion” is a good choice here. We want to determine which of the parcels is “better” (so which arrives damaged less), so we will use the one-sided version
