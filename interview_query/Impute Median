'''
Youâ€™re given a dataframe df_cheeses containing a list of 
the price of various cheeses from California. The dataframe has missing values in the price column.

Write a function cheese_median to impute
the median price of the selected California cheeses in place
of the missing values. You may assume at least one cheese is not missing its price.

import pandas as pd

def cheese_median(df):
    mean_imputation = df.Price.median()


    df['Price'] = df['Price'].fillna(mean_imputation)

    return df
