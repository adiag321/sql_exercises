You are given a dataframe with a single column, 'var'.

Calculated the t-value for the mean of ‘var’ against a null hypothesis that 

Note: You do not have to calculate the p-value of the test or run the test


import pandas as pd

def t_score(mu0, df: pd.DataFrame):
    
    x = (df.mean() - mu0)/(df.std()/pow(df.count(),1/2))
    return x
