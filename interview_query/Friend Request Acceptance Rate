'''
A social media company re-designed its UI to include notifications to users when they receive friend requests.

Evaluate if this change increased the friend request acceptance rate. Find the acceptance rate for friend requests sent in the four weeks prior to (and including) July 2nd, 2022.

Note: The acceptance rate is the percentage of sent requests that were accepted.*

Assume that nobody sends or accepts the same request twice. We will consider two friend requests to be duplicates when their sender and receiver are the same

select ifnull( count(accepted_at)/count(*),1 ) as acceptance_rate

from friend_requests fr left join requests_accepted ra
on fr.requester_id = ra.requester_id 
and ra.accepter_id = fr.receiver_id
WHERE DATE(sent_at) BETWEEN SUBDATE("2022-07-02", INTERVAL 4 WEEK) AND "2022-07-02"
