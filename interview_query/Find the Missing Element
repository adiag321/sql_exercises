You are given two lists: a full list and a missing list. The full list contains a list of integers, while the missing list contains all the 
integers from the full list except for one. Your task 
is to create a function that finds the missing element.


def one_element_removed(full, missing):
    full.sort()
    missing.sort()


    j = 0

    for i in range(len(full)):
        if full[i] == missing[j]:
            j+=1
        else:
            return full[i]
---------------------------------------------
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of bitwise XOR operation. The XOR operation returns 0 if there are an even number of 1s in the binary representation of a number, and it returns 1 if there are an odd number of 1s.

We can XOR all the numbers in both the lists. All the numbers that are present in both the lists will be XORâ€™d to 0 and the number which is missing will be the result of the XOR operation.

Here is the python code:

def one_element_removed(full, missing):
    m = 0
    for i in full:
        m ^= i
    for i in missing:
        m ^= i
    return m
