You are tasked with flagging users who post fake comments on Amazon to then give to the modeling team for further analysis.  

How would you initially go about filtering users who post fake comments on Amazon?

Let’s say that the team needs more data points faster. How would you scale out the effort with minimal manual intervention?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clarifying Questions - What do you consider a fake comment? - Do you need to buy the product in order to make a comment? - Do we have access to labeled data?

Assessing Requirements - We need to calculate a probability that a comment is fake, that a user write a review on a product that they have not bought.

Solution - We want to distinguish two types of fake comments: Fake accounts created to add good comments on a product or bad on the competitor’s and real accounts that are writing comments on a product they never bought

We should look at the date of creation of the account, previous orders, previous comments, previous logged in, to distinguish the fake account from the real one.
We can check also if they bought the product they are commenting on.
Then by using logistic regression or Random Forrest, we should be able to calculate a probability that each comment is fake
If the data is not labelled, we can only look if the account has purchased the product before and label the data on further analysis.
Validation -We can measure the precision(True Positive/Predicted Positive), Recall (True Positive/Positive) and as there is an ambivalance between the false negative and the false positive, we shout incresa the F1 Score (2PrecRecall/(Precision + Recall))
