Let 
�
X be a continuous random variable with its probability density function, mean, and median denoted as 
�
�
(
�
)
,
�
,
f 
X
​
 (x),μ, and 
�
m respectively.

Show that if 
�
�
f 
X
​
  is a strictly decreasing function, 
�
≥
�
m≥μ.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Strictly decreasing –> long right tail

long right tail –> mean > median,

as median is robust to outliers way out there, but the mean is not and will be pulled in that direction, making the mean larger than the median.

This is more explaining it than ‘showing’ it as a proof, but I’m guessing likely sufficient.
