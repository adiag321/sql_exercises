We’re given two tables, a table of notification_deliveries and a table of users with 
created and purchase conversion dates. If the user hasn’t purchased then the conversion_date column is NULL.

Write a query to get the distribution of total push notifications before a user converts.


with converted_user_notifications as(
select 
distinct u.id as user_id,
count(notification) as total_pushes
from notification_deliveries n inner join users u on u.id = n.user_id
where n.created_at < u.conversion_date 
group by u.id)


select 
coalesce(total_pushes,0) as total_pushes,
count(*) as frequency
 from  users u left join converted_user_notifications cu on u.id = cu.user_id

where u.conversion_date is not null
group by 1
