'''
Given a list of strings of letters from a to z, create a function, sum_alphabet, that returns a list of the alphabet sum of each word in the string.

The alphabet sum is the sum of the ordinal position of each of the stringâ€™s letters in the standard English alphabet ordering. So, the letter a will have a value of 1, z will have a value of 26, and so on.

As an example of the alphabet sum of a string, the string sport will have an alphabet sum of 19 + 16 + 15 + 18 + 20 = 88.

        cursum  = 0
        for ch in w:
            cursum += d[ch]
        res.append(cursum)
    
    return res
