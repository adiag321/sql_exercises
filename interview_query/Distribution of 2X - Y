Given that 
�
X and 
�
Y are independent random variables with normal distributions, what is the mean and variance of the distribution of 
2
�
−
�
2X−Y when the corresponding distributions are 
�
∼
�
(
3
,
4
)
X∼N(3,4) and 
�
∼
�
(
1
,
4
)
Y∼N(1,4)?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the linear combination of the two independent normal random variables is a normal random variable, we can solve the first problem of the mean by just substituting the given values into the formula for the existing two means in the problem statement.

For the two variables 
�
X and 
�
Y, the mean is calculated simply by:

�
[
2
�
−
�
]
=
2
�
[
�
]
−
�
[
�
]
=
5
E[2X−Y]=2E[X]−E[Y]=5

The variance however is calculated differently. The variance of 
�
�
+
�
�
aX+bY is:

Var
[
�
�
+
�
�
]
=

2
Var

Var

�
�
Cov
(
�
,
�
)
Var[aX+bY]=a 
2
 Var[X]+b 
2
 Var[Y]+abCov(X,Y)

where 
Cov
(
�
,
�
)
Cov(X,Y) is the covariance between 
�
X and 
�
Y. The covariance between 
�
X and 
�
Y is zero since they are independent from each other. That way we can calculate this out:

Var
[
