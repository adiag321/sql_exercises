Weâ€™re given a table of bank transactions with three columns, user_id, a deposit or withdrawal value (determined if the value is positive or negative), and created_at time for each transaction.

Write a query to get the total three-day rolling average for deposits by day.

Note: Please use the format '%Y-%m-%d' for the date in the outout
