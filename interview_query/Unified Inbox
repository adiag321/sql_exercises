Instagram wants to change the messaging system on its platform to interact with other platforms and third-party businesses.

For instance, Instagram wants to be able to partner with a business like GrubHub to allow the company to send automated messages to Instagram users who also use GrubHub.

How would you determine whether this change is a good idea?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**clarifying questions:**
what is the end goal?

to increase eat orders for grubhub ordered from instagram?
to be able to order food, basic items and turn instagram into online shop with 1click order?



**assesing requirements:**
assuming there is biz goal to increase interaction and drive sales to other enterprises via instagram 
the metrics to use are 'num orders via instagram', avg sales over period of day,week,month - daily completed orders(DCO) same for week,month - WCO,MCO.
dco,wco,mco. similar metrics could be about the automated messages  the success order rate within 5min of showing app - num of messages viewed daily/weekly/monthly divided by num food ordered - as a general metric

biz-2-user engagement metrics could be another metric to use.
these are the metrics to focus on!

**solution:**

check if we can track how many foods were ordered thru app before introducing automated msgs.
do a/b testing on feature and see the user engagement, success rate metric thru the metrics above.

check if target metrics go up.

**validation:**

use data to convince or not the mangmt if introducing it will make sense for the business
