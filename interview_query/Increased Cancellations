You work as a data scientist at Lyft. Last week you see a 5% increase in rider cancellations.

What would you investigate to figure out what happened?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defining metric/Formula:
#cancellations/ #bookings by rider
Check for seasonality, if itâ€™s W/W or Y/Y trend.
Check external factors like, competitor offerings , holiday season , weekday vs weekend etc
Check each segment, geography, app device type, OS(ios vs android), new vs repeat user, age of account etc.
Check for product internal issues like app response time, driver wait times increased, price surge, promo codes applied failed . cta issues with driver tracking, drivers ETA stable or increasing?
Did wait times > ETA for other riders?
Check as per user journey where they might have faced issue? Within how much time of booking did they cancel? How long did it take to assign a driver?
