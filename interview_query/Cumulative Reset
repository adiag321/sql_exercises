Given a users table, write a query to 
get the cumulative number of new users added by the day, with the total reset every month. 



with h as(
select 
date(created_at) as date, 
count(*) as total_users
from users 
group by 1)


select t.date , sum(u.total_users) as monthly_cumulative
from h t left join h u on t.date >= u.date 

and month(t.date) = month(u.date) and year(t.date) = year(u.date)
group by 1
