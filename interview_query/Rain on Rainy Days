'''
Youâ€™re given a dataframe df_rain containing rainfall data. The dataframe has two columns: day of the week and rainfall in inches.

Write a function median_rainfall to find the median amount of rainfall for the days on which it rained.

Note: You may assume it rained on at least one of the days.

import pandas as pd

def median_rainfall(df_rain):
    

    x = int(df_rain[ df_rain['Inches']>0].median())
    return x
