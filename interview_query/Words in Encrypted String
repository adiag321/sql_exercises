You are required to extract a specific word target_word from an encrypted document. Fortunately, you have the basic information needed to decrypt that document.

The equation used to encrypt the document is as follows:

�

(

E 
n
​
 (x)=(I(s)+n)mod26

Where:

�
s is a letter
�
(

)
I(x) is the number representing the position of the letter in the alphabet (1 for A, 2 for B, etc.)
�
n is an arbitrary integer.

(

E 
n
​
 (x) is the encrypted letter.
Return the number of occurrences of target_word in the document after decryption.

Note: The document only has upper case letters and spaces.
