Letâ€™s say we have a table representing vacation bookings. Write a query that 
returns columns representing the total number of bookings in the last 90 days, last 365 days, and overall.

Note: You may assume that today is the 1st of January 2022.

SELECT 
sum(case when timestampdiff(day, check_in_date, '2022-01-01') <90 then
 1 else 0 end ) as num_bookings_last90d,
  sum(case when timestampdiff(day, check_in_date, '2022-01-01') <=365 then
 1 else 0 end ) as num_bookings_last365d,
count(reservation_id) as num_bookings_total

from bookings 
where check_in_date is not null 
and check_out_date is not null

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT 
SUM(CASE WHEN DATE_ADD(check_in_date, INTERVAL 3 MONTH) >= '2022-01-01' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_bookings_last90d, 
SUM(CASE WHEN DATE_ADD(check_in_date, INTERVAL 1 YEAR) >= '2022-01-01' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_bookings_last365d,
COUNT(reservation_id) AS num_bookings_total
FROM bookings;
