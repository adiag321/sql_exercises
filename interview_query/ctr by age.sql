'''
Given two tables, search_events and users, write a query to
  find the three age groups (bucketed by decade: age 0-9 falls into group 0, age 10-19 to group 1, â€¦, 90-99 to 
  group 9, with the endpoint included) with the highest clickthrough 
  rate in 2021. If two or more groups have the same clickthrough rate, the older group should have priority.

Hint: If a user that clicked the link on 1/1/2021
  is 29 years old on that day and has a birthday tomorrow 
  on 2/1/2021, they fall into the [20-29] category. If the same 
  user clicked on another link on 2/1/2021, he turned 30 and will fall into the [30-39] category.
