'''
The analytics team at a social media platform wants to analyze the short-term trends in 
daily user growth. For this task, they want you to calculate the 3-day rolling weighted average for new daily users, where the current day has a weight of 3, the previous day has a weight of 2, and the day before has a weight of 1.

The platform logs new records into the acquisitions table for the days on which new users arrive. Otherwise, it skips the date.

Write a SQL query to calculate the 3-day rolling weighted average for new daily users from the acquisitions table.

Round the average to two decimal places.
