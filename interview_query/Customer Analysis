'''
You’re given a dataframe containing sales data from a grocery store chain with columns for customer ID, gender, and date of sale.

Create a new dataset with summary level information on their purchases including the columns:

customer_id
gender
most_recent_sale
order_count
most_recent_sale should display the date of the customer’s most recent purchase. order_count should display the total number of purchases that the customer has made.
