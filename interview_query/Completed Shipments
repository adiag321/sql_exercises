Letâ€™s say that youâ€™re a data scientist working on a distribution team at Amazon.

Create a report displaying which shipments were delivered to customers during their membership period.

If the transaction is shipped during the membership period, column is_member should have the value Y. If not, the column should have the value N.

Hint: You may assume that customer_id is unique and that shipments are made only to registered customers.
