Letâ€™s say you work for Meta. You are given the table messenger_sends. Find the total number of unique conversation threads.

Note: In some entries, the receiver_id and sender_id are switched from 
the initial message. These entries should be treated as part of the same thread.


SELECT count(distinct least(sender_id, receiver_id), 
greatest(sender_id, receiver_id)) as total_conv_threads FROM 
messenger_sends
