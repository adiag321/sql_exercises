'''
You have been given a table tbl_numbers with only one column: int_numbers. It can have one integer number value per row in a sequential manner.

Write a query to return the number repeated by one times its own value.

For example, the integer number 5 would appear five times in the output (1 times 5).

with recursive cte as(

    select int_numbers , 1 as counter from tbl_numbers
    union all
    select int_numbers, counter+1
    from cte
    where counter < int_numbers
)
select int_numbers as seq_numbers from cte order by seq_numbers
