Capital approval rates have gone down for our overall approval rate. Let’s say last week it was 85% and the approval rate went down to 82% this week which is a statistically significant reduction.

The first analysis shows that all approval rates stayed flat or increased over time when looking at the individual products:

Product 1: 84% to 85% week over week
Product 2: 77% to 77% week over week
Product 3: 81% to 82% week over week
Product 4: 88% to 88% week over week
What could be the cause of the decrease?

This would be an example of Simpson’s Paradox which is a phenomenon in statistics and probability. Simpson’s Paradox occurs when a trend shows in several groups but either disappears or is reversed when combining the data.

In this specific example, each product’s approval rates are Binomially distributed with count

  and probability

p

​
 . Then the mean for each distribution would be

We can define our variables as:

What most likely occurred is that Product 2 had more applications compared to the rest of the products in week 2.

This resulted in a heavier weighting of Product 2’s approval rate in the weighted average. Since Product 2 has a much lower approval rate compared to the others the heavier weighting resulted in an overall decrease in approval rates although each approval rate stayed consistent or rose.
