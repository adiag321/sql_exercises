Given an unfair coin with the probability of heads and tails not being equal, can you make an algorithm that could generate a list of uniformly distributed zeros and ones only using the results of the coin tosses?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This problem can be solved with a method called the von Neumann corrector. Observe that even if the probability is not fifty-fifty, we can get an equal distribution of two values by taking the combination of outputs.

The algorithm works on pairs of bits, and produces output as follows:
1. When you get heads-tails you count the toss as heads or 1.
2. When you get tails-heads you count it as tails or zero.
3. You ignore the throws that come up twice the same side whether it’s

�
TT or 
�
�
HH.

Regardless of the distribution of heads and tails, the output will always have a fifty-fifty split of 0s and 1s. The algorithm will discard (on average) 75% of all inputs, however, even if the original input was perfectly random to start with.
