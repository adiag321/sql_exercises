'''
We’re given three tables representing a forum of users and their comments on posts.

Write a query to get the percentage of comments by each user where that user also upvoted their own comment.

Round the percentage_self_voted column values to 0 decimals. For example, 33.3333% should be displayed as 33.

Note: A user that doesn’t make a comment should have a 0 percent self-upvoted.
