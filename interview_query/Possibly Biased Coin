You’re given a two-sided coin that could be fair or biased. How would you figure out whether or not the coin is biased?

Design a test and describe which outcome would tell you that the coin is biased.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One can design the following test. Flip the coin for 
�
=
100
N=100 times (making sure that every flip is independent of the others) and count the number of heads/tails.

The Null hypothesis is that the coin is fair (Not biased), and the alternative hypothesis is that the coin is biased. Given the number of trials 
(
�
)
(N), a given level of confidence (typically 95%), we might be able to decide whether the coin is biased or not with 95% confidence.

Here is how we can obtain the confidence interval; We can consider each coin toss as a Bernoulli distribution with probability of head as 
�
p. For a fair coin, one may assume 
�
(
�
)
=
�
=
0.5
P(T)=H=0.5. Also, 
�
N trials of a Bernoulli distribution give us a Binomial distribution. The Binomial distribution has a mean of 
�
�
np (=50 for 100 tosses of a fair coin) and standard deviation of 
�
�
(
1
−
�
)
np(1−p)
​
  which equals 5 for 
�
=
100
n=100 and 
�
=
0.5
p=0.5.

Furthermore, based on the central limit theorem, a binomial distribution as described above can be well approximated as a normal distribution with 
�
=
50
μ=50 and 
�
=
5
σ=5. Therefore the 95% confidence interval around the mean would be the range of 
(
50
−
1.96
∗
5
,
50
+
1.96
∗
5
)
(50−1.96∗5,50+1.96∗5) in which the multiplier of 1.96 can be extracted from the normal table.

Finally, if the number of heads/tails of the 
100
100 coin tosses lies within the range above, which is approximately 
(
45
,
55
)
(45,55), we do not have significant evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis, and we have to assume that the coin is fair. Otherwise, we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative.
