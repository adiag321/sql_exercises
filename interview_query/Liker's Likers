A dating websiteâ€™s schema is represented by a table of people that like other people. The 
table has three columns. One column is the user_id, another column is the liker_id 
which is the user_id of the user doing the liking, and the last column is the date time that the like occurred.

Write a query to count the number of likerâ€™s likers (the users that like the likers) if the liker has one.

with has_one as(
select distinct user_id, count(liker_id)  from likes
group by user_id
having count(liker_id)!=0)


select  count(*)  as count, user_id as user from likes where user_id in (
    select liker_id from (
select l.liker_id , count(h.user_id) from has_one h join likes l  on h.user_id = l.user_id

group by l.liker_id)k)

group by user_id
