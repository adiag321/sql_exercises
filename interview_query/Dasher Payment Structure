Let’s say you work for a food delivery company. We have a payment structure for delivery drivers where they make 5% of every order. A product manager wants to launch a new payment structure for delivery drivers where delivery drivers make 2.5% of each order and 
$
50
$50 after each fifth order.  

How would you determine the success of this new structure?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The solution starts with a simple base scenario calculation and continues adding complexities that reflect real-world scenarios.

Deterministic scenario

Let’s see what the calculation looks like in the simplest scenario. Suppose there are 
�
N delivery drivers in total and 
�
�
x 
i
​
  denotes the number of orders delivered by 
�
ith driver in a month (a reference of time horizon is necessary). Let’s also assume each delivery costs 
�
p dollars (we could take 
�
p to be the average cost of deliveries in real-world scenarios).

Scenario 1: 5% commission for every order

Simplifying the above expressions we arrive at the following relation

Now we can solve for when

So we can use this simplier expression that excludes the floor function to solve for 
�
p. Let's also call the summation

∣x∣ for brevity.

Since 
�
p represents the average order's price (total revenue/
�
N), the 
�
Ns will cancel out if we express

p in this form. Thus, we have that the that

 's structure will be more profitable when total revenue is greater than

Company strategy can be then:

Implement the new structure in the cities where food is costly or people consume in larger amounts. For example, in cities like New York, the average amount (
$
$) per order will be higher because people consume more here and the cost of food is much more than in any town area.

Implement the new structure seasonally. For example, in the festive season, people tend to order a larger amount of food. Doordash can introduce this new structure in the summer
