Given three random variables independently and identically distributed from a uniform distribution of 0 to 4, what is the probability that the median of them is greater than 3?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we break down this question, we’ll find that another way to phrase it is to ask what the probability is that at least two of the variables are larger than 3.

For example, if look at the combination of events that satisfy the condition, the events can actually be divided into two exclusive events.

Event 
�
A: All three random variables are larger than 3.
Event 
�
B: One random variable is smaller than 3 and two are larger than 3.

Given these two events satisfy the condition of the median > 3, we can now calculate the probability of both of the events occurring. The question can now be rephrased as

�
(
Median
>
3
)
=
�
(
�
)
+
�
(
�
)
P(Median>3)=P(A)+P(B)

Let’s calculate the probability of the event A. The probability that a random variable > 3 but less than 4 is equal to 1⁄4. So the probability of event A is:

)
⋅
(

/
4
)
=

/
64
P(A)=(1/4)⋅(1/4)⋅(1/4)=1/64

The probability of event B is that two values must be greater than 3, but one random variable is smaller than 3. We can calculate this the same way as the calculating the probability of A. The probability of a value being greater than 3 is 1⁄4 and the probability of a value being less than 3 is 3⁄4. Given this has to occur three times we multiply the condition three times.

)

P(B)=3((3/4)⋅(1/4)⋅(1/4))=9/64

Therefore the total probability is
