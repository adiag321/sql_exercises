Amy and Brad take turns in rolling a fair six-sided die. Whoever rolls a “6” first wins the game. Amy starts by rolling first.

What’s the probability that Amy wins?
-------------------------------------------
Via Linear Equations

Let’s set some definitions. We’ll call the event that Amy wins 
�
A and the event that Brad wins 
�
B.

Consider the probability that the play that goes first wins; call this event 
�
F. In our case, at the start of the game, 
�
(
�
)
=
�
(
�
)
P(F)=P(A) holds.

Now note that when Amy loses the first role (does not get a 6), Brad is now the “first” player. So

P(B)=P(F)P(a

​
 P(A)

Also note that 
�
(
�
)
+
�
(
�
)
=
1
P(A)+P(B)=1, since someone must win. This gives us a system of linear equations we can solve for since we have 2 equations and 2 unknowns.

Via Geometric Series

Alternatively, one could view 
�
(
�
)
P(A) as an infinite sum. Call results of the rolls of Amy and Brad 
{
�
�
}
�
=
1
∞
{a 
i
​
 } 
i=1
∞
​
  and 
{
�
�
}
�
=
1
∞
{b 
i
​
 } 
i=1
∞
​
  respectively. Then, 
�
(
�
)
P(A) can be represented as:

�
(
�
)
=
∑
�
=

∞
�
(
�

∣
�

)
P(A)=

∑

​
 P(a

The probability that neither Amy nor Brad roll a 6 is 
(
5
/
6
)
2
(5/6) 
2
 , so this sum can be rewritten as:

�
(
�
)
=
∑
�
=

∞
(
5

)

�
(
1
/
6
)
P(A)= 
i=0
∑

​
 (5/6)

This is a geometric series, so its sum is
