Bob takes a test and tests positive for the disease. Bob was close to six other friends they all take the same test and end up testing negative. 

The test has a 1% false positive rate and a 15% false negative rate. 

Whatâ€™s the percent chance that Bob was actually negative for the disease?
--------------------

fp = 0.07
fn = 0.15* 7tp + fp = 1
bayesian:

P(act neg| test pos)  = p(act neg| test pos)/ p(act neg| test neg) + p(actually pos| test pos)
= fp/fp + tp = 0.07/(0.07+0.99) = 6.6%
