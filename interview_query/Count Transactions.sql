  Letâ€™s say we have an annual_payments table. Answer the following three questions via SQL queries and output them as a table with the answers to each question.

How many total transactions are in this table?
How many different users made transactions?
How many transactions listed as "paid" have an amount greater or equal to 100?
Which product made the highest revenue? (use only transactions with a "paid" status)

with h as(
select  4 as question_id , max(amount) as c, product as product_id  from annual_payments 
where status = 'paid'
group by product order by c desc limit 1)



SELECT 1 as question_id , count(*) as answer FROM annual_payments

select  3 as question_id ,count(*) as greater100 from annual_payments 
where status = 'paid' and amount >= 100
