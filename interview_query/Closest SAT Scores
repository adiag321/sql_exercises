Given a table of students and their SAT test scores, write a query to return the two students with the closest test scores with the score difference.

If there are multiple students with the same minimum score difference, select the student name combination that is higher in the alphabet. 

with h as(
select 

id, student,score, 
lead(score)over(order by score desc)as nxtscore,
lead(student)over(order by score desc)as nxtstudent
from scores
order by score desc),

h2 as(
select 
student, nxtstudent,
score - nxtscore as score_diff
from h
where score - nxtscore is not null

order by score_diff asc) 
select nxtstudent as one_student , 
student as other_student, score_diff from h2
 limit 1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT 
    s1.student AS one_student
    , s2.student AS other_student
    , ABS(s1.score - s2.score) AS score_diff
FROM scores AS s1
INNER JOIN scores AS s2
    ON s1.id != s2.id
        AND s1.id < s2.id
ORDER BY 3 ASC, 1 ASC
LIMIT 1
