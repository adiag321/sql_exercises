'''
Youâ€™re given a table that represents search results from searches on Facebook. The query column is the search term, position column represents each position the search result came in, and the rating column represents the human rating of the result from 1 to 5 where 5 is high relevance and 1 is low relevance.

Write a query to get the percentage of search queries where all of the ratings for the query results are less than a rating of 3. Please round your answer to two decimal points.

select round(count(*)
/(select count(query) from search_results),2) as percentage_less_than_3

from search_results

group by query
having max(rating)<3

WITH low_rating AS (
