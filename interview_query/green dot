Let’s say we’re working on a new feature for LinkedIn chat. We want to implement a green dot to 
show an “active user” but given engineering constraints, we can’t AB test it before release.

How would you analyze the effectiveness of this new feature?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would structure my answer as follows: 1) Ask some clarifying questions 2) Metrics and validation methodology 3) Possible outcomes and action recommendations

CLARIFY

When is the green dot visible? During chat or even outside of a chat? Assume it is visible in the inbox. In other words, only for people that the user has already had a chat history.

Why do we want to build this green dot? What value does it bring to LinkedIN? I assume this is to encourage users to start and continue conversations. The more active users are in conversations, the more overall engagement on LinkedIN and the more potential for revenue.

Who is this feature built for?

Can users opt-out?

METRICS

Conversation metrics: # of messages sent, # of message senders
Sister team metrics:
# of connection requests sent, AVG num of connections per user (more messaging, more potential connections)
Increased private messaging might cannibalise other forms of interaction, such as timeline/feed activities (which are public).These can be tracked by: # of comments made, # of posts made, # of likes or shares
LinkedIN overall:
Num of active users
Num of paying members
Average revenue per user
Validation Method w/o AB testing

Observational studies (such as PSM). Build a test and a control group who have similar likelihood of engaging in messaging (“convert”) and are otherwise balanced on all covariates.
