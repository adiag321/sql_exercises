'''
Letâ€™s say you work at Allstate. Allstate is running N online ads right now. The table ads contains all those ads, ranked by popularity via the id column (e.g., the entry with id = 1 is the most popular, etc.).

Create a subquery or common table expression named top_ads containing the top 3 ads (by popularity) and return the number of rows that would result from the following operations

ads INNER JOIN top_ads
ads LEFT JOIN top_ads
ads RIGHT JOIN top_ads
ads CROSS JOIN top_ads
Note: Please make the join_type column in your output have the values inner_join, left_join, etc. for each of their respective join types

Note: Please return only one query with each number in a different row
