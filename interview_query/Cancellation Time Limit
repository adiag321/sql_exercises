Lyft is trying to optimize its ride-sharing program. The current ride-sharing app shows the time for a ride to arrive after you make a request.

How would you decide the time threshold where a customer should be able to cancel a ride request without triggering a penalty fee?

**clarifying questions:**

what is the end goal? what other data we have on city,driver,customer?
is there competitor companies using similar mechanism?

**solution:**

penalty fee should be triggered if the driver has already arrived to close and 
spent his gas and time to get there.

not triggering penalty can be done in 2 ways: time or distance based.

after x min penalty is triggered or after 100m left to the customer penalty is applied.

x min can be avg calculated based on city, season, time of day - all specific to a city.
distance-based fee can be calculated based on current official price of gas in that day and how much gas that driver spent 
driving from his original location when he picked up the request and customer location.

another way to calculate time threshold is to factor 
in avg time it takes to reach customer from driver location; avg time specific to that city, traffic etc.

if the driver already spent 50% of the time after he picked up the request - the penalty fee is applied.
since he already spent 50% in the way to pick up the customer.

or this time threshold can be a weighted sum of 2 variables - both time and distance, e.g. 
if he spent 40% of the time and covered 50% of the distance from his original location - the penalty fee is triggered.

actually this can be priced dynamically daily - based on avg time spent 
waiting/driving by other drivers in that city. for this to work - this data must be collected
