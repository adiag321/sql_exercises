'''
You are given an array of numerical values, bootstrap samples, and size for a confidence interval.

Write a function that performs bootstrap sampling on the given array and calculates the confidence interval based on the given size.

Note: The function should return a tuple containing the minimum and maximum values of the confidence interval rounded to the tenths place.
