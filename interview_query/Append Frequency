Given a string sentence, return the same string with an addendum after each character of the number of occurrences a character appeared in the sentence.

Note: donâ€™t treat the spaces " " as characters. Also; do not return the addendum for those characters that also appear in the discard_list.

    res = ''
    d = dict(Counter(sentence))
    discard_list.append(' ')
    for s in sentence:

     
        if s not in discard_list:

            res += s + str(d[s])

        elif s in discard_list:
            res += s

    

    return res
