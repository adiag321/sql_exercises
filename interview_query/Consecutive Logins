You want to understand how often users log in to your companyâ€™s website. You're given a table named user_activity_log with the following columns:

user_id (INT) - Unique identifier for each user.
timestamp (DATETIME) - The exact time the user performed an activity.
activity_type (VARCHAR) - The type of activity the user has performed. The only two types of activities are LOGIN and LOGOUT.
Write a SQL query that determines the time elapsed (in minutes) between consecutive logins for each user. The result should show each user and the gap between their logins. Your output should contain the following columns: user_id, current_login, previous_login, minutes_elapsed. Round to the nearest minute

with h as(
select 

user_id, timestamp as current_login,
lag(timestamp,1)over(partition by user_id order by timestamp ) as previous_login

from user_activity_log

where activity_type = 'LOGIN')

select 

user_id, current_login, previous_login, 

abs(round((julianday(previous_login)-julianday(current_login))*24*60)) as minutes_elapsed
 from h
 where previous_login is not null
