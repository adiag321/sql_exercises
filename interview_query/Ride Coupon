A ride-sharing app has probability 
�
p of dispensing a 
$
5
$5 coupon to a rider. The app services 
�
N riders. How much should we budget for the coupon initiative in total?
A driver using the app picks up two passengers.
What is the probability of both riders getting the coupon?
What is the probability that only one of them will get the coupon?

---------------------
1. We can model the number of coupons dispersed, which we will call 
�
C, as a binomial distribution with success probability 
�
p and number of trials 
�
n. Our expenses are then 
$
5
⋅
�
$5⋅C in total. Since 
�
∼
�
(
�
,
�
)
C∼B(n,p),
�
[
5
�
]
=
5
�
�
,
and
Std
[
5
�
]
=
5
�
�
(
1
−
�
)
E[5C]=5np,andStd[5C]=5 
np(1−p)
​
 
To be safe, we should budget our expect expenses, plus one standard diviation for some wiggle room. Our budget, 
�
B, will then be:
�
=
5
(
�
�
+
�
�
(
1
−
�
)
)
B=5(np+ 
np(1−p)
​
 )
. 2. Let 
�
1
C 
1
​
  and 
�
2
C 
2
​
  be the events that the first and second rider get the coupon, and assume the event are independent. For them both getting the ride:
�
(
�
1
∩
�
2
)
=
�
2
P(C

​
 ∩C 
2
​
 )=p

For only one of them getting the ride:
�
(
�
1
∩
�
2
�
)
+
�
(
�
1
�
∩

)
=
