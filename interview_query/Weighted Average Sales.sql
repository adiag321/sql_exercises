'''
The sales department is conducting a performance review and is interested in trends in product sales. They have decided to use a weighted moving average as part of their analysis.

Write a SQL query to calculate the 3-day weighted moving average of sales for each product. Use the weights 0.5 for the current day, 0.3 for the previous day, and 0.2 for the day before that.

Note: Only output the weighted moving average for dates that have two or more preceding dates. You may assume that the table doesnâ€™t skip dates.
