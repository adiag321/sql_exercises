clarifying questions:

how is the product doing in terms of what? i might ask the manager or not to clarify what exactly he wants

but if he is asking about general way of things,then its my own step to select metrics

solution:

i will choose metrics like:

1.new signup rate - num of new signups in this month\total signups in current year

2.usage rate - can be complex weighted metric like: 0.3* avg num of users daily using the google docs + 0.2rate of new docs created Month-over-Month + 0.5avg satisfaction of users(it can be measured through surveys, ratings, or feedback from customer support interactions.)

3.feature adoption rate: this metric measures how quickly new features are adopted by users. it can help you understand whether new features are resonating with users and whether they are adding value to the product.

4.revenue: this metric measures the amount of money generated by google docs. it can help you understand the financial health of the product and whether it is meeting business goals. 5.retention rate: this metric measures the percentage of users who continue to use google docs over time. it can help you understand how sticky the product is and whether users are finding value in it
