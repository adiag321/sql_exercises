You are a data architect consulting for a large retail company, which has experienced slowdowns in generating monthly and quarterly inventory analyses.

What might be the reason for the OLAP systemâ€™s performance, specifically when handling monthly and quarterly reports?
What aggregation strategy might you look into in order to mitigate this issue?
State any assumptions upfront.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Clarifying Questions:**

what is the end goal? 
how much data is accessed to generate monthly report?
what is the data size, num rows etc?
how many data analysts try to access the data to generate reports?
is data structured, semistructured?
how many writes goes into the db on a day of generating report?
is it write intensive?
do we have access to spark to do real time streaming analytics?

**Assessing Requirements:**
assuming there is 1 data analyst team, that needs to generate monthly report on tables of size 50 gb.
and quarterly report on 3 tables with size of 1tb.

**Solution:**
check the data access patterns, most frequently accessed tables,
create,use indexes on them.

check if the olap db is suitable at all for the requirements and nature of workload


**Validation:**

measure for the time, performance with std db tools before using indexes and after.


**Additional Concerns:**

data privacy law, what data can be accessed about drivers profiles.
