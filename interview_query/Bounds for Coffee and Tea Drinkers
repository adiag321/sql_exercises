A survey asked 100 respondents two questions:

Do you like tea?
Do you like coffee?
70% of respondents said they liked coffee, and 80% of the respondents said they liked tea. Only 10% of respondents said they liked neither.

Based on this survey, what are the upper and lower bounds for the proportion of the population that like tea and coffee?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some standard notation: 
�
T is the event that a respondent likes tea, 
�
C is the event that a respondent likes coffee, and 
�
‾
T
  and 
�
‾
C
  are the events that a respond doesn’t like tea/coffee (the complement of 
�
T/
�
C)

Let’s write down the information the question gives us:

The sample size is 100
�
(
�
)
=
0.8
P(T)=0.8
�
(
�
)
=
0.7
P(C)=0.7
�
(
�
‾
∩
�
‾
)
=
0.1
P( 
T
 ∩ 
C
 )=0.1
We want to find 
�
(
�
∩
�
)
P(T∩C) get a confidence interval for it, but we don’t have enough information to use the common formula for finding the union of two probabilities, which is

�
(
�
∪
�
)
=
�
(
�
)
+
�
(
�
)
−
�
(
�
∩
�
)
P(T∪C)=P(T)+P(C)−P(T∩C)
… or do we? De Morgan’s law tells us that the complement of the union of two events is the intersection of their complements.

�
∪
�
‾
=
�
‾
∩
�
‾
T∪C
 = 
T
 ∩ 
C
 
So we can use these two equations to find the percentage of people who like both tea and coffee as:

�
(
�
∩
�
)
=
�
(
�
)
+
�
(
�
)
+
[
1
−
�
(
�
‾
∩
�
‾
)
]
=
0.8
+
0.7
−
0.9
=
0.6
P(T∩C)=P(T)+P(C)+[1−P( 
T
 ∩ 
C
 )]=0.8+0.7−0.9=0.6
Now we can use the standard formula for a confidence interval for a proportion to get a reasonable lower and upper bound on the percentage

�
�
(
�
^
∣
�
)
=
�
^
±
�
�
�
^
(
1
−
�
^
)
�
CI( 
p

​
 ∣γ)= 
p
^
​
 ±Z 
γ
​
  
n
​
 
p
^
​
 (1− 
p
^
​
 )
​
 
Since the question gives no specific specifications, we’ll take the standard confidence level of 
�
=
0.95
γ=0.95, in which case 
�
�
Z 
γ
​
  will be 1.96 (while usually you don’t have to calculate 
�
Z values by hand, the value of 1.96 for a 95% confidence interval is so standard that it wouldn’t hurt to memorize it).

So finally, our bounds are:

0.6
±
1.96
⋅
0.6
⋅
0.4
100
≈
(
0.553
,
0.647
)
0.6±1.96⋅ 
100
​
 
0.6⋅0.4
​
 ≈(0.553,0.647)
