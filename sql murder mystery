14887	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership 
number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that
 included "H42W".	14887	Morty Schapiro	118009	4919	Northwestern Dr	111564949

Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think 
you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to 
find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially confident in your SQL 
skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. 
Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.

I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name 
but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has 
red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she 
attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.
